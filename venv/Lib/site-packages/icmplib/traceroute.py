    Determine the route to a destination host.

    The Internet is a large and complex aggregation of network hardware,
    connected together by gateways. Tracking the route one's packets
    follow can be difficult. This function utilizes the IP protocol
    time to live field and attempts to elicit an ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED
    response from each gateway along the path to some host.

    :type address: str
    :param address: The destination IP address.

    :type src_addr: str
    :param address: The IP address of the gateway or host to which
        the message should be sent.

    :type count: int
    :param count: (Optional) The number of ping to perform per hop.

    :type interval: int or float
    :param interval: (Optional) The interval in seconds between sending
        each packet.

    :type timeout: int or float
    :param timeout: (Optional) The maximum waiting time for receiving
        a reply in seconds.

    :type id: int
    :param id: (Optional) The identifier of the request. Used to match
        the reply with the request. In practice, a unique identifier is
        used for every ping process.

    :type max_hops: int
    :param max_hops: (Optional) The maximum time to live (max number of
        hops) used in outgoing probe packets.

    :type fast_mode: bool
    :param fast_mode: (Optional) When this option is enabled and an
        intermediate router has been reached, skip to the next hop
        rather than perform additional requests. The count option then
        becomes the maximum number of requests in case of no responses.

    :rtype: list of Hop
    :returns: A list of Hop objects representing the route to the
        desired host. The list is sorted in ascending order according
        to the distance (in terms of hops) that separates the remote
        host from the current machine.

    :raises SocketPermissionError: If the permissions are insufficient
        to create a socket.

    Usage::

        >>> from icmplib import traceroute
        >>> hops = traceroute('1.1.1.1')
        >>> last_distance = 0

        >>> for hop in hops:
        ...     if last_distance + 1 != hop.distance:
        ...         print('Some routers does not respond')
        ...
        ...     print(f'{hop.distance} {hop.address} {hop.avg_rtt} ms')
        ...
        ...     last_distance = hop.distance
        ...

        2       194.149.169.49       7.55 ms
        3       194.149.166.54       12.2 ms
        !       Some routers does not respond
        5       212.73.205.22        22.1 ms
        6       1.1.1.1              13.5 ms
